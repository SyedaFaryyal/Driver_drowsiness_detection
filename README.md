# Driver_drowsiness_detection
This project aims to detect signs of driver drowsiness in real-time using computer vision. The system leverages facial landmarks and eye aspect ratio (EAR) to monitor the driverâ€™s eye movements and blinks to identify fatigue or drowsiness. If signs of drowsiness are detected, an alert is triggered to help prevent accidents.
